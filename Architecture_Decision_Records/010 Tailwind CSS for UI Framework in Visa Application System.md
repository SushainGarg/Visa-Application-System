## Decision Drivers

* Flexibility and Customization: Empower developers to create unique and tailored designs without being confined to pre-defined components.
* Maintainability: Promote clean and organized CSS through utility classes, avoiding CSS specificity issues and reducing code complexity.
* Rapid Development: Accelerate UI development with a vast array of utility classes and no need for custom CSS frameworks.
* Performance: Minimize CSS overhead by only applying necessary styles, potentially improving page load times.

## Considered Options

* Tailwind CSS
* Bootstrap
* Material UI
* Custom CSS
