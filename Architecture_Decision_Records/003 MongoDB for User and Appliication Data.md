# MongoDB for User and Application Data in Visa Application System

## Context and Problem Statement

The Visa Application System requires a database solution that can efficiently store and manage diverse user data, application information, and potential unstructured data types, while also offering scalability and performance to handle anticipated growth.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Data Diversity: The system needs to accommodate various data types, including structured and unstructured data, to manage user profiles, application forms, supporting documents, and potential future requirements.
* Flexibility: The schema-less nature of MongoDB allows for adaptability in data structures as the system evolves.
* Scalability: MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities support seamless growth as the user base and data volume increase.
* Performance: MongoDB offers efficient performance for reads and writes, essential for a smooth user experience and data retrieval.
* Integration: MongoDB integrates well with the MERN stack and AWS cloud environment.

## Considered Options

* MongoDB
* Relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* Other NoSQL alternatives (Cassandra, Couchbase)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MongoDB", because
MongoDB's document-oriented model, schema flexibility, horizontal scalability, high performance, and seamless integration with the MERN stack and AWS make it the most suitable choice for the project's data needs.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Good, because Accommodates diverse data types and flexible schema for evolving requirements.
* Good, because Scales horizontally to handle large volumes of data and user growth.
* Good, because Enhances performance for fast data retrieval and application responsiveness.
* Good, because Integrates well with the MERN stack and AWS services.
* Bad, because May require additional expertise in data modeling and query optimization compared to relational databases.
* Bad, because Has limited support for ACID transactions, which might necessitate careful design for certain operations.


### Confirmation

Compliance with this ADR will be confirmed through database configuration reviews and data access patterns to ensure the use of MongoDB for user and application data storage.
