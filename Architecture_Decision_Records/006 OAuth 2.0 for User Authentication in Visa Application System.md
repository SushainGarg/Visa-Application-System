# OAuth 2.0 for User Authentication in Visa Application System

## Context and Problem Statement

The Visa Application System requires a secure, standardized, and flexible approach for user authentication and authorization to protect sensitive user information, manage access control, and potentially leverage third-party authentication providers for convenience and user experience.

## Decision Drivers

* Security: Implement industry-standard protocols to safeguard user credentials and prevent unauthorized access to the system.
* Standardization: Adopt a widely-used authentication framework for interoperability, developer familiarity, and potential integration with third-party services.
* Flexibility: Allow users to authenticate using their existing accounts from trusted providers (e.g., Google, Facebook), potentially reducing friction and improving user experience.
* Scalability: Handle a growing user base effectively and support future integrations with additional authentication providers.

## Considered Options

* OAuth 2.0
* Basic authentication
* Custom authentication systems

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "OAuth 2.0", because
OAuth 2.0 offers a secure, standardized, flexible, and scalable framework for user authentication and authorization, aligning with the project's security requirements, emphasis on industry standards, potential for third-party integrations, and anticipated growth.


## Consequences

### Good 

* Industry-standard security framework for robust protection.
* Delegation of authentication to trusted providers for convenience and reduced password fatigue.
* Fine-grained access control for managing user permissions.
* Wide support among libraries and tools for easier implementation.

### Bad

* Increased complexity in authentication flow and user experience, potentially requiring careful design and user guidance.
* Need for proper configuration and secure token management to mitigate vulnerabilities.
* Dependency on third-party providers for user authentication.


## Confirmation

Compliance with this ADR will be confirmed through security audits, code reviews, penetration testing, and monitoring of authentication logs to ensure secure implementation and usage of OAuth 2.0.
