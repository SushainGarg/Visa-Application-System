# Microservices Architecture for Visa Application System

## Context and Problem Statement

The Visa Application System necessitates an architectural approach that promotes modularity, scalability, independent deployment, fault isolation, and development agility to accommodate anticipated growth, potential feature additions, and the need for continuous updates without compromising system availability.

## Decision Drivers

* Modularity: Decompose the system into smaller, independent services to enhance maintainability, reusability, and testability.
* Scalability: Independently scale services based on their specific workloads and resource requirements, optimizing resource allocation and performance.
* Independent Deployment: Deploy and update services separately without affecting other parts of the system, enabling faster innovation and continuous delivery.
* Fault Isolation: Contain failures within individual services, preventing cascading effects and improving overall system resilience.

## Considered Options

* Microservices architecture
* Monolithic architecture
* Service-oriented architecture (SOA)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Microservices architecture", because
Microservices offer superior modularity, scalability, independent deployment, fault isolation, and development agility, aligning with the project's anticipated growth, continuous delivery needs, and focus on resilience and maintainability.

### Consequences

* Good, because Increased modularity for better maintainability and reusability.
* Good, because Enhanced scalability through independent scaling of services.
* Good, because Faster deployment and updates through independent service deployment.
* Good, because Improved fault isolation for greater resilience.
* Good, because Empowered development teams for autonomy and faster innovation.
* Bad, because Increased complexity in communication and orchestration between services.
* Bad, because Potential overhead for managing distributed systems and infrastructure.
* Bad, because Need for robust service discovery and load balancing mechanisms.


### Confirmation

Compliance with this ADR will be confirmed through code reviews, architecture diagrams, and deployment strategies to ensure adherence to microservices principles and best practices.
