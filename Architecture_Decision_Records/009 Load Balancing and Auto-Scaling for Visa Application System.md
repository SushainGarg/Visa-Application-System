# Load Balancing and Auto-Scaling for Visa Application System

## Context and Problem Statement

The Visa Application System (VAS) anticipates variable traffic patterns and load, necessitating a scalable and resilient infrastructure to maintain performance, availability, and cost-efficiency.

## Decision Drivers

* High Availability: Ensure continuous system availability and responsiveness under varying loads.
* Performance Optimization: Maintain optimal performance and user experience during peak usage periods.
* Cost Optimization: Scale resources dynamically to match demand, avoiding unnecessary costs during low traffic periods.
* Scalability: Handle unexpected traffic spikes gracefully without manual intervention.

## Considered Options

* Load Balancing and Auto-Scaling (ELB and ASG) on AWS
* Manual scaling
* Third-party load balancing solutions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: " Load Balancing and Auto-Scaling (ELB and ASG) on AWS", because
it Provides integrated, scalable, and cost-effective solution within the AWS environment, aligning with project's cloud-based architecture.

### Consequences

## Good 

* Automatic scaling based on demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
* High availability and fault tolerance through load distribution and instance replacement.
* Integration with other AWS services for monitoring and management.
* Potential cost savings during low traffic periods.

## Challenges

* Increased cost during high traffic periods (needs careful monitoring and cost optimization strategies).
* Potential complexity in configuration and management, requiring attention to setup and maintenance.

## Implementation Details

# Load Balancing

* Employ Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for distributing traffic across multiple instances.
* Configure ELB health checks for detecting and replacing unhealthy instances.

# Auto-Scaling

* Utilize Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to automatically launch or terminate instances based on defined scaling policies.
* Monitor key metrics (CPU, memory, request count) to trigger scaling events.
* Define scaling policies to determine when and how to scale instances.

### Confirmation

# Compliance will be confirmed through

* Successful distribution of traffic across instances by ELB.
* Responsive scaling of instances by ASGs based on demand.
* Integration with monitoring and alerting systems.
