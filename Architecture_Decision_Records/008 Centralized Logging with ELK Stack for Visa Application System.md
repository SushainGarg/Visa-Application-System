# Centralized Logging with ELK Stack for Visa Application System

## Context and Problem Statement

The Visa Application System (VAS) consists of multiple microservices, a frontend application, and database components, generating diverse logs for troubleshooting, auditing, and performance analysis.

# Effective log management is crucial for

* Identifying and resolving issues
* Monitoring system health and performance
* Auditing security events
* Gaining insights into user behavior and application usage


## Decision Drivers

* Centralized Logging: Consolidate logs from all components for unified analysis and correlation.
* Scalability: Handle increasing log volumes with Elasticsearch's distributed architecture.
* Search and Analytics: Empower efficient log searching, filtering, and analysis using Elasticsearch's capabilities.
* Visualization: Create interactive dashboards and visualizations for insights and monitoring using Kibana.

## Considered Options

* ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
* Traditional logging systems (syslog, file-based)
* Cloud-based logging services (AWS CloudWatch, Loggly)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "ELK stack", because
ELK Provides comprehensive logging, search, analytics, and visualization capabilities, aligns with project's technical stack and AWS environment.


### Consequences

## Good 

* Centralized log management for easier troubleshooting, auditing, and analysis.
* Scalable log storage and search with Elasticsearch.
* Customizable dashboards and visualizations with Kibana.
* Integration with AWS services (e.g., CloudWatch Logs, Elasticsearch Service).

## Challenges

* Expertise required for setup, configuration, and maintenance of ELK stack.
* Potential for high storage costs for large log volumes (addressed by AWS Elasticsearch Service pricing models).

## Implementation Details

# Log Collection:

* Use Logstash or Filebeat to collect logs from microservices, frontend, database, and AWS services.
* Configure log shippers for parsing, filtering, and forwarding logs to Elasticsearch.

# Elasticsearch:

* Deploy Elasticsearch cluster for log storage and indexing.
* Optimize cluster configuration for performance and storage efficiency.
* Consider AWS Elasticsearch Service for managed solution.

# Kibana:

* Set up Kibana for access to Elasticsearch data.
* Create dashboards and visualizations for log analysis and monitoring.

### Confirmation

# Compliance will be confirmed through:

* Logs being successfully collected and indexed in Elasticsearch.
* Kibana dashboards and visualizations being accessible and functional.
* Integration with monitoring and alerting systems (if applicable).

### Additional Considerations

## Security

* Implement authentication and authorization for ELK stack access.
* Protect sensitive log data with encryption and access controls.

## Maintenance

* Monitor cluster health and performance.
* Regularly update ELK components for security patches and bug fixes.

## Backup and Recovery

* Implement a backup strategy for Elasticsearch data.
* Plan for disaster recovery scenarios.
